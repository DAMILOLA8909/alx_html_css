# ALX HTML & CSS Project

This repository contains my learning projects in HTML and CSS as part of the ALX program.  
It demonstrates the use of semantic HTML, CSS styling, Flexbox layout, and basic responsive design.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. `html_basic/`
This directory contains my first HTML practice files:
- **`base_index.html`** → A very simple HTML page with the basic structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).  
- **`index.html`** → Homepage with multiple sections:
  - Headings and paragraphs
  - A clickable image (link to ALX website)
  - A learners’ table with names, ages, and countries
  - Structured using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`  
- **`tweets.html`** → Page with:
  - An embedded Tweet
  - Navigation link back to `index.html`
  - Same structure as index for consistency

### 2. `css_basic/`
This directory extends the HTML pages with styling:
- **`base.css`** → Global styles (fonts, body colors, links, spacing).  
- **`styles.css`** → Custom styles (Flexbox layout, backgrounds, article/aside widths, and table design).  
- **`index.html` & `tweets.html` (copied here)** → Updated to include:
  - `<link>` to both `base.css` and `styles.css`
  - Responsive layout using Flexbox
  - Improved design with light yellow and light blue theme
  - A styled “D” logo in the header

- **Forms** for user input (register & contact pages in extended work)  
- **CSS Flexbox** for layout (body column + main row with article and aside)  
- **Responsive design** with `viewport` meta tag and mobile-friendly adjustments  
- **Custom styling** with colors, logo, and consistent theme
